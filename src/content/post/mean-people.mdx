&lt;p&gt;I don’t read &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/index.html"&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; as often as I should, to read not because of his startup super-star status, but for his insights into the world of &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html"&gt;startups&lt;/a&gt;. His latest article, &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/mean.html"&gt;Mean People Fail&lt;/a&gt;, flies right into the face of the age old &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism"&gt;aphorism&lt;/a&gt; “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_guy#The_.22nice_guys_finish_last.22_view"&gt;nice guys finish last&lt;/a&gt;”. Well worth your time today to go have a read.&lt;/p&gt;

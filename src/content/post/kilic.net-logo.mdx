I've started tweaking some aspects of this weblog, starting with a refresh of the logo. The current design (which is been with me for several years now) looks dated, low quality, and a bit uninspiring. I'm a developer first! You can see transition of the old to new logo in the image below: 

<a title="kilic.net logo - previous by Serdar Kilic, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/serdar/15756872787"><img alt="kilic.net logo - previous" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7487/15756872787_d9a27353d0.jpg" width="500" height="308" /></a> 
&amp;nbsp;

The new logo has dropped the border around the icon, introduced a modified colour palette, and also introduced a transparency gradient originating from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

As any web developer would know, you just don't have a single icon these days. With such vast array of platforms these days they have their own way of displaying "favourite" icons. As of now, I've specified a good old Web 1.0 <a href="http://kilic.net/favicon.ico">favicon.ico</a>, an iPhone icon (using the apple-touch-icon meta tag) and also for the Windows 8.1 devices, a whole range of logo sizes to suite the Live Tiles format. The Windows 8.1 icons are specified in my <a href="http://kilic.net/browserconfig.xml">browserconfig.xml</a> file that's referenced via an msapplication-config meta tag on this page.

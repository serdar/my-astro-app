&lt;p&gt;This video is a must watch on how web design has evolved over the last 20 years or so. Amazingly, Iâ€™m happy to have been involved with the web for 16 of those years (though no where near at the calibre of Zeldman).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="281" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/104641191" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

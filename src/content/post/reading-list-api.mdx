If you have a Windows 8 tablet or laptop you'll be familiar with the &lt;a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/reading-list-app-faq#1TC=windows-8"&gt;Reading List&lt;/a&gt; bookmark app from Microsoft. Whilst great as it is, we have a native application used to save &lt;i&gt;web &lt;/i&gt;based resources, yet not have any &lt;i&gt;web &lt;/i&gt;way of retrieving that same data!Â &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://microsoft.uservoice.com/forums/173122-general/suggestions/6658706-reading-list-api"&gt;submitted a request&lt;/a&gt; to Microsoft via its UserVoice feedback system to allow for an open API access to the Reading List service, thus enabling the community to build additional methods of accessing said bookmarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://microsoft.uservoice.com/forums/173122-general/suggestions/6658706-reading-list-api"&gt;Vote up&lt;/a&gt; if you think it's a good idea!&lt;br /&gt;

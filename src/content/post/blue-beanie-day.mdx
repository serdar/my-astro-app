November 30 for most web standard-istas represents <a href="http://bluebeanieday.tumblr.com/post/103643267347/have-we-got-a-beanie-for-you">Blue Beanie Day</a>, a showing of support to web standards. In recognition of this day my <a href="https://twitter.com/serdar">Twitter</a> profile photo has been updated to show my support. 

Standards FTW!

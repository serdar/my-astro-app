A few of us at work got to renew our laptops and we've all gone for the latest Dell M3800.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sporting a 3200x1800 (touch) display, 16GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD this is a beast of a machine to work with. Scott's post about &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LivingAHighDPIDesktopLifestyleCanBePainful.aspx"&gt;High-DPI displays&lt;/a&gt; couldn't have come at a better time, there's plenty of well written apps (Visual Studio 2013) and not some great ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being 15" inches it's larger than what I would prefer but it tips the scale just a bit over 2kg - so it's going to be much more practical lugging it home each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Microsoft removed the &lt;a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-81-preview-removes-windows-experience-index"&gt;windows experience index&lt;/a&gt; from 8.1 there's no scoring of this unit, but the screen is really bright and startup times are one of the best I've seen.&lt;br /&gt;

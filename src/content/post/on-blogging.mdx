&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that I really haven't been keeping this site updated as frequently as I would have hoped to but here's some tidbits on what's new around here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the last six years I've been hosting this site and others with Media Temple (mt) and after hearing that they've been acquired by GoDaddy I decided that it's time to move my site. I had previously migrated domains over to Hover (I use NetRegistry for .au domains) from GoDaddy. See a theme here? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The website move is slightly more involved as I was also using Media Temple to host my DNS records. I ended up moving my DNS to Amazon Route 53, whilst not free, it has some great tools and it really isn't that expensive - unless this domain gets a ridiculous amount of DNS queries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By day I'm a .NET developer but I've actually never hosted my own sites on .NET, this had to change! After visiting TechEd this year I decided to learn more about Windows Azure. The blogs of &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/"&gt;Scott Hanselman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/"&gt;Scott Guthrie&lt;/a&gt; were great to get up to speed on the how and what things need to be done. That said, if you use Visual Studio it's surprisingly easy to publish a site straight from the IDE - things get even easier if you're using Visual Studio 2013! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few hoops later I had migrated my sites and emails over to Azure - actually, I'm using a hosted Exchange service for my emails that's linked to my Azure Active Directory. Of course this all meant that I had to swap out blog engines but I'll save that for a future post. &lt;/p&gt;

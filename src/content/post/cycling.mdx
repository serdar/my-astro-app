Professional cycling has it’s work cut out to improve its image that’s been tarnished through rampant drug and illegal supplement abuse. Not a day goes by as I sift through my <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/">Cycling News</a> feed that there isn’t some mention of a pro cyclist that is coming off probation, . Lance, personally, was a huge disappointment.

I still enjoy cycling as a sport and will continue to keep up with the pro-cycling races albeit with a slight scepticism when the winners step up to the podium.

My Trek Madone that was <a href="/previously/2010/07/24/stolen_-_trek_madone_45_-_glenwood_nsw_area">stolen-then-recovered</a> is destined for a complete make-over, new wheels, new parts – this is going to be a side-project of mine to completely rebuild it. Should be fun!

&lt;p&gt;Professional cycling has it’s work cut out to improve its image that’s been tarnished through rampant drug and illegal supplement abuse. Not a day goes by as I sift through my &lt;a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/"&gt;Cycling News&lt;/a&gt; feed that there isn’t some mention of a pro cyclist that is coming off probation, . Lance, personally, was a huge disappointment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still enjoy cycling as a sport and will continue to keep up with the pro-cycling races albeit with a slight scepticism when the winners step up to the podium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My Trek Madone that was &lt;a href="http://weblog.kilic.net/previously/2010/07/24/stolen_-_trek_madone_45_-_glenwood_nsw_area"&gt;stolen-then-recovered&lt;/a&gt; is destined for a complete make-over, new wheels, new parts – this is going to be a side-project of mine to completely rebuild it. Should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

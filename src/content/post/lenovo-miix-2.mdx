&lt;p&gt;Whilst waiting on the mrs for I popped in to the local JB Hi Fi stored to have a look at the new Lenovo Miix 2 8" Windows tablet (say that ten times fast!). After reading great reviews about this device I really thought this might fill the lack of a similarly speced Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, what most reviews fail to state is that there's only 9GB of user storage space left (on a 32 GB device), and this is without Office 2013 installed! I had a look to see if there was any bloat ware that could be removed and there isn't much space that can be saved on this device - so they're running pretty lean already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you are in the market for a Windows tablet before you swipe that credit card have a quick peek at what storage space is actually available. You may be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
